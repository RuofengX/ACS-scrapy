Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Minfar,5.0,"Our son recently went off to college out of state.  Its sort of a tradition in both mine and my wife's family to gift some sort of a tool set when a son or daughter goes off into the world, and I was looking for ""just the right"" kit.  I wanted a kit with a tape measure, level, hammer, pliers, and common wrenches and sockets.  This kit had it all!  Most kits run up the piece count with stupid things you seldom use, but this kit doesn't do that (not sure what I'd ever use those two small clamps for, but other kits add even more junk.) This kit was easily the best one I found on the market, even at twice the price.  This should last our son many years.  He's already used it a number of times at the dorm (and once folks found it he had a tool kit, they came knocking)."
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Tyler Bell,4.0,Some tools feel cheaper than others. I wasn’t expecting much at less than $0.50 per tool. Everything stays where it should for the most part except for a few sockets. The most annoying thing is that they gave me a wrong size socket. Instead of a 1/2 I got a 15/32
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Anya,5.0,"I needed a basic set of tools for my apartment.  This does the job.  It is not meant to be Craftsmen or NAPA quality, but if you need ""just enough"" tools, this will suit your needs."

Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Sandy A,4.0,"I needed to buy a set of tools for all the random things so I will have to fix in my new place. This set has already lasted me through two furniture constructions, two window repairs , and some overall maintenance within my place."
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Omar GlRd,5.0,good price for all the basic tools to keep a house running. They are sturdy and haven't given me troubles so far.

Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Al (Pop's) Means,4.0,"It's a nice little tool kit! Especially for beginners. It's got both household &amp; mechanics tools in one case. The case is a little flimsy, but other than that, it's alright.  I would recommend it for someone looking for their first tool set."
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Travis T.,4.0,"I bought it to keep in my boat for any issues that arise.  It has everything you'd need for a young homeowner or a college kid, or as a travelling set for truck, cabin, boat etc."
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,just me,3.0,Needed a quick simple kit of tools to be shipped to a location so I didn't have to pack it in the suitcase.<br>That part worked out great and it was very handy to have when I got there. But you kind of get what you pay for. The Phillips screwdriver tip wore out in two days of use. The hacksaw blade failed immediately into a dull mess. Overall it worked out well but they are cheap tools for a quick cheap job
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Jason Stephens,5.0,Awesome
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,The Albatross,4.0,"Look, my brother took my decent tool kit. Since he denied it, I had to start over and I was short on time and funds.<br><br>This isn’t a great kit, but it’s ok— see what you use often- then go out and buy a decent version of that.<br><br>And for G-d sakes, step one should be a good pair of safety glasses. Even if you are just putting together your ikea furniture, if the thought crosses through your head, “do I need safety glasses, then you do."

Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Evan,5.0,All the right tools to get the job done.
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Beth smith,5.0,This is a good solid tool kit. I have bought these in the past for my kids starting college. Parents: Ignore the eye rolls and insist your children take one of these to college or their first apartment. Both my sons said it was the most used thing they had. They also said they were the only student on their floor that had tools. It made them very popular.
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Rosa,3.0,This is well priced but you definitely get what you pay for. The most frustrating thing about this set is that the tools aren’t secured well in the case so when you close the lid half of the tools fall out.
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Artur,3.0,"the quality of the instruments is very poor, but for this money you should not expect better quality"
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Adriana Seymour,4.0,"As some others have mentioned, the tools do not always stay in the places intended. The pliers did not go into the holder after the very first use. This is a bit of a pain but does not detract from the usefulness of the kit. I bought this for my daughter who was moving away from home. We used the tools a lot when setting up her new digs. I would still buy this again as it has a great variety of tools and they seem to be well made for the price paid."
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Aidan Congleton,3.0,"I’m not exactly sure what I was expecting from a cheap Amazon tool set, but I was hoping for more from a billion dollar company. The saw for one is not much better that tinker tots saw with a jerry rigged blade. The hammer looks the most effective of the bunch, screwdriver sets are great, claps have strong springs on a cheap body. My razor in particular was already rusted out of the box, was honestly hoping for bigger of everything else, the wrenches are 4 of each system but essentially the same size. The wire cutters were cheap but very capable from what I can tell. Levels a level, and the needle nose was what to expect from them, the small box of nails and screws for what I imagine was framing pictures was nifty but not essential. Last but not least the sockets. This is the only thing I imagine made this box what it’s worth, due to the number of them and their small sizes, however, I don’t think even the biggest ones could take the lug nuts off my Honda Civic. I might be wrong on that but it would be close. I think Amazon could put more Money in a bigger box with longer and stronger tools, and still sell it for the same price and make a profit. The mass production capabilities although proven impressive for size and economy, the durability of mass production methods makes such economics an investment to catastrophe."
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Mark D,5.0,This has everything you need for a home kit but slightly smaller than regular size tools. The ratchet and hammer have some good weight so there is dome pretty good quality for what you pay for.
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Michael &amp; Kari,5.0,I finally found something my husband likes and it appears they are sturdy enough to handle the jobs he does around the house.
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Taylor ,4.0,Purchased as a gift for a friend’s housewarming party and they loved it.<br>The kit includes a little of everything and just what they needed to put together little things around their first house.<br>Tools seemed durable.
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Jeff,4.0,Tools are great the case is horrible.
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Wally461,5.0,Nice simple set of tools. Perfect for son's car and college dorm.
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,"Pedro Hart, Jr.",5.0,Great set.
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Thomas,4.0,"Not the highest quality yet sturdy and durable,  very good for home maintenance as advertised"
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Garrett Burke,3.0,The variety of tools is great the case that holds the tools not so much as after opening it once the tape measure and the pliers would not stay where they were supposed to be.<br><br>I would have to very quickly shut the case while holding them in place and then moving my hands out of the way to keep them from falling down and keeping the case from closing.<br><br>You get what you pay for with this.
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Peanuts,5.0,"I have used many of the tools in this package, multiple times since purchasing. I am happy with the tools. The plastic case is ok, it could be better, it works but it does not feel very sturdy nor does it hold all the tools as securely as I would like. However, I did not buy the product for the case so I give it five stars and do recommend it to others on the caveat that this item may want you to purchase a good tool box or bag."
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Amazon Customer,2.0,"El producto es bueno y cumple su cometido, pero, recien lo recibi escribi indicando que habia llegado abierto<br>y faltaba la cinta de medir. Mi comunicacion nunca fue contestada y tampoco recibi otra cinta, lo cual era mi interes ( no devolver el articulo)."
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Q,5.0,Bought this when I moved into my new apartment. Totally love it. Used it so many times already from assembling a two tv stand and my sons crib. Highly recommend if you are moving in for DIY projects in and around the place. Just bought another set for my parents house. Box helps keep everything organized.
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,MIchael Gutierrez,5.0,"All the tools feel well made, great for someone just starting there collection/moving and needs a little bit of this and that."
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,L. Vossler,3.0,"Really like the quality and the convenience of the tools, especially for the price point.  The downside is that I do not like using them as I know it is a pain to get the case to close up again.  Give the case a slight bump and you are putting all your sockets back in their slot."
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,A. Antonio,4.0,"This might be the cheapest tool set, but it's not the worst by any means.<br><br>It is missing a few things you'll wish had, like a legit monkey wrench.  It has some things you might never use.  It also has some items that are uncommon for kits like this that end up being very useful, like the mini level.  That thing is perfect for leveling a new washer and dryer.<br><br>The quality of the tools is mostly mediocre.  They work, but are bad enough that you don't want to use them.  None have broken yet, but that could happen.<br><br>For the money this isn't a bad option, but there are better quality options for more money, that could be a better value over the long run."
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Alyx,4.0,"Some of the pieces don’t sit quite right in the box so they fall out when it’s opened, but I can’t say anything seriously negative about this set! It’s great!"
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Mark Howard,5.0,Like the product
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Tammy Brown,4.0,"I am a single woman living alone, and I think this tool kit will be perfect for my everyday basic needs around the house.  I needed a nice, but not too big of a set, and I think this has everything I’ll ever need for the small assembly and other jobs that I do.  Maybe now I will be able to quit asking for help from another handyman.  Lol"
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Tassia,5.0,I purchased this set for my husband I and must say he is in awe. Its value for the money based on the price and he can finally fix a few things that's he been overlooking.
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,john,3.0,"first the pros: there are a decent amount of tools for your money, enough for basic around the house stuff.<br><br>the cons are that the case is terrible, the socket barely fit on the ratchet, and the plyers may be worse than the dollar store version of them.<br><br>overall for the money that you ar spending it's probably worth the price, don't expect it to handle anything over light duty stuff"
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Amanda S,3.0,"The pliers don't snap in place, they fall out as soon as I try to close the box. Plastic latches are flimsy and may break easily."
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Amazon Customer,3.0,"A lot of tools for the price. However, some of the tools looked used or are scratched when initially inspected the box. Not sure what that’s about. Quality wise, I haven’t testing anything but the “used” tool part is annoying…"
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Darcy,4.0,Good quality for price. Definitely cheaper materials but this will hold up fine for small tasks.
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Zamir,2.0,Sizes not in SI system as  exposed during ordering
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Jerome McNeal,3.0,I’m not sure if it’s just my box or everyone else’s. I’ve been putting up with it for awhile but now it’s just annoying. The tools all work great but nothing stays in its place in the box. As soon as you try to open or close it multiple pieces will fall out. It’s highly annoying and tedious.
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Supersoker,3.0,"Bought this for a gift and I have to say that the quality was very subpar. If used for casual usage, this will work but don't expect quality. Long term use I don't see these holding up."
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,djovida,5.0,I bought this kit to keep in the house for little jobs around the house.
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Alex Contreras,5.0,"As always, Amazon Basics tools continue to exceed expectations. Great value for such a low cost."
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,DariaFae,3.0,Since of the pieces just don't fit well. They keep falling out. Hence every time I open it or try to close it its a game of trying to keep the pieces in place. Quite annoying for no reasoning. The case is 😑😝😓
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,M. Song,3.0,"This tool set is great for the price, and it basically has possibly everything I'd need.<br>The only problem that bothers me is the tools don't stay in place due to the cheap plastic liners.<br>I just can't close the box because tools fall."
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Anne C.,4.0,"I recently just moved to an apartment on my own and always had roommates with tools so I've never had to purchase my own set of tools before. This is great for small fixes around the apartment or assembling things around the apartment. Tools seem pretty sturdy. My only complaint is the little bolts always coming out of the tool box when opening. Other than that, everything has performed as it should."
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,C. Horton,2.0,"The tools are fine but the case is horrible. The tools don’t stay where they belong and anytime I open or close the case, pieces a fall out. I’ve missed the return window but really wish I had spent an extra $10-$25 for a set with a better case."
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Anonymous ,5.0,Got this for my fiancé for his birthday and he absolutely loved it. It has everything offered in the picture and packaged nicely.
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Umer Bakali,4.0,"This isn't by any means a super high-quality toolset, but it does not need to be. Generally, the rule of thumb for tools is to buy ones that are inexpensive and then replace those that break or wear out with higher-quality ones.  For the price, this is a very solid toolkit that will pull its weight for the occasional repair you need to make in the house or on the car."
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Amazon Customer,4.0,"I just recently moved and was looking around for a toolbox that has all the basic tools at a reasonable cost.  A lot of other tool kits I looked had too many specific tools or were missing basic essential tools such as pliers or messing tape.  Plus it's small, portable, and fits easily anywhere.  Only downside is the tools feel cheap, and could break if not used carefully."
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Angie,3.0,Solid first set for the kid.  Has everything she needs.
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,jcpace,5.0,N/A
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Ernest Allen,4.0,I used these tools to fix my car bumper. They work great for the job
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Laura Mitchell,1.0,Tools  are severely rusted in 8 months.  They have been in the case since purchased.  This Amazon product is a cheap ripoff.  This changes my mind about Amazon products.  Only a 30 day window to return.  More cheap products for the landfill.
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Anonymous Customer,5.0,"This kit is super comprehensive and compact - without feeling flimsy.  I don’t foresee a need to have drawers full of random tools with this sitting around, I’ll likely buy one for each area of the house so that I always have one near!"
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,NW83,4.0,"The tools are good. I actually have no problem with any of the tools. They meet all my purposes. My only complaint would be the box they come in. Everytime I open the box, all the sockets, screws, and pliers fall out.  Design a box that the tools can stay in without falling out Amazon, and you'll 5 stars."
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,KRAMARK,5.0,Very nice tools!
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Cassondra ,5.0,My dad loves it.
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Brigido Garcia,5.0,Great product I will recommend to my friends.
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Amazon Customer,5.0,"We purchased this tool set for a new cabin in the woods.  It has everything we need to build furniture, put up and level paintings, etc."
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Paige,3.0,I ordered because I needed a toolbox with the basic tools to have in a home. Quick shipment. I've only used the tape measure so I cant say a whole lot about durability on these tools. But at least I have tools now.
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Belinda,4.0,Only dislike is how quickly my teenagers managed to lose half the tools but that's not an amazon issue
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Benjamin Kwon,4.0,For the cost this is well suited for an average person that seldom needs tools but not for people that need tools on a daily basis. For the average joe it's perfect.
Amazon Basics 131-Piece General Household Home Repair and...,Doc B,4.0,Nice tool set for the money. But for some reason the end of the box cutter keeps falling off every time you retract the blade.
